# CodeReviewAITool
This project is a web application designed to facilitate code reviews and analysis for developers. 
It leverages GitHubâ€™s API to fetch repository files, analyze code quality, and provide insights based on specific criteria. 
The system is built using Python with FastAPI as the web framework, and the project dependencies are managed with Poetry. 
The goal is to streamline the code review process, making it easier for developers to maintain high-quality code standards.
